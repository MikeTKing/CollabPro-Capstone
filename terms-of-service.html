        <h2>Terms of Service</h2>

            <li>Not use the application in a way that harms other users or the application itself.</li>
            <li>Be responsible for securing your device, as your data is stored locally in your browser’s <code>localStorage</code>.</li>

        <h3>3. Data Responsibility</h3>
        <p>All data entered into <em>CollabPro</em> (e.g., tasks, comments, user profiles) is stored locally on your device. You are responsible for:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Backing up your data if needed (e.g., by exporting <code>localStorage</code> data).</li>
            <li>Clearing your browser’s storage if you wish to delete your data.</li>

        <ul>
            <li>Data loss due to browser issues, device failure, or user actions (e.g., clearing <code>localStorage</code>).</li>
            <li>Security breaches on your device that may expose data stored in <code>localStorage</code>.</li>
            <li>Any damages resulting from the use of the application.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>5. Termination</h3>
